After seeing [Contextual Lenox Header](http://forum.xda-developers.com/crossdevice-dev/sony-themes-apps/guide-contextual-lenox-header-lollipop-t3302089) on the frontage few days ago, I remember the days when I enjoyed Carbon ROM Contextual Status Bar, however I had to drop their ROM eventually because they were slow at releasing (KK/Lollipop can't remember which), at the time I looked for a way to bring the feature back, but i was an early novice for that, but now after seeing Lenox header on the frontapage, I was inspirited to do just that and so, I present "Zeus Contextual Expanded Status Header"
